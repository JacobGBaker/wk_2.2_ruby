## Navigating this app
All the notes and problems are written as RCAVs. To solve problems, you'll need to modify various combinations of an action, it's corresponding view, and occasionally, it's original route. There are some intentional typos in there, so make sure that spelling and naming conventions all match up.

There are four main groups of content, each in a separate controller:

1. Basics
2. Hashes
3. Params
4. Forms

Examples will be marked with comments that look like:

    #=== Example ======================

and problems will be marked with comments that look like:

    #=== Problem ======================
